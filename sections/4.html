      document.write("<p>There are four steps to translation: initiation, elongation, translocation, and termination. Initiation starts when a small ribosomal subunit binds to the mature mRNA and moves to the start codon (AUG). The large ribosomal subunit binds tRNA and the small ribosomal subunit binds to the mRNA. The large ribosomal subunit has three binding sites: the p site, the A site, and the E site. Once the ribosome is bound to the mRNA strand, which in your case is <b><i>"+mrna+"</b></i>, tRNA molecules begin binding to the codon on the mRNA chain; the codons on the mRNA bind to the anticodons on the tRNA. Next, the large ribosomal subunit of the ribosome binds to the tRNA at the p site which completes the ribosome. Now the ribosome is able to proceed with the process of translation.</p>");
      document.write("<p>The second step of translation is known as elongation. During elongation, a new tRNA molecule enters the A site and the amino acid, which is currently in the P site, is transferred to the amino acid in the A site, since a peptide bond is formed between the two amino acids. Next, translocation occurs. During translocation, the ribosome moves over one codon position in the 5’ to 3’ direction. A new tRNA molecule enters the A site and the tRNA molecule in the E site is released. Elongation and translocation keep occurring until the termination stage is reached.</p>");
      document.write("<p>Termination occurs when a stop codon is reached and the polypeptide chain is released. Once the polypeptide chain, which is made up of amino acids that are bound to each other by peptide bonds, is released, the chain folds into a 3D shape. This 3D shape is known as a protein, and the amino acid sequence, which in your case is <b><i>"+aminoacids+"</b></i>, impacts the shape of the protein, which impacts its function.</p>");
