Although the pre-mRNA is transcribed from the template(antisense) strand, because the transcription creates complementary bases, it ends up matching the coding(sense) strand. The RNA Polymerase continues moving along the template strand until it reaches the terminator. This marks the end of Transcription’s second phase: Elongation.</p><br>");
